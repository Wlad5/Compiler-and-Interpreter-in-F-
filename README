The files in this directory serve as a starting point for the solution
to Part A in the assignment.  You (probably) only need to modify the
files

    lexer.fsl
    parser.fsy
    compiler.fs
    syntax.fs

If you modify lexer.fsl or parser.fsy, then (in a terminal; not from
the F# REPL) type

    $ dotnet build

In order to test and run your solution, start F#, load everything, and
then compile using Compiler.compProg:

    $ dotnet fsi
    > #load "main.fsx";;
    > let ast = Parse.fromString "1 + 2";;
    > let ins = Compiler.compProg ast;;
    > let code = Asm.asm ins;;
    > VM.exec code;;

or use Main.comps (to compile and assemble a program from a string) or
Main.compf (to compile and assemble a program from a file).

    $ dotnet fsi
    > #load "main.fsx";;
    > let code = Main.comps "1 + 2";;
    > VM.exec code;;

The following are not implemented.  It is your task to do it:

    * In syntax.fs: ASTs for the operators && and || and unary minus
      (i.e., negation) and for let, if, read, and write.

    * In parser.fsy: Grammar rules for the operators && and || and
      unary minus (i.e., negation) and for let, if, read, and write.

    * In compiler.fs: Many operators, let, if, and function calls with
      other than 1 argument; function definition with other than 1
      argument.
